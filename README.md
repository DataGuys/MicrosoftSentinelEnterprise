## Understanding the Enterprise Cost Model

For organizations spending $500K+ annually on Azure Sentinel, understanding the complete cost model is critical for optimization.

### Azure Sentinel Cost Factors

Azure Sentinel's pricing model for large enterprises includes several components:

1. **Log Analytics data ingestion** - Charged per GB ingested
   - Analytics Tier: ~$2.76 per GB
   - Basic/Auxiliary Tier: ~$0.74 per GB (73% savings)
   - Capacity Reservation: Discounted rates for committed volumes

2. **Log Analytics Cluster** - Dedicated infrastructure for high-volume environments
   - Starting at 1,000 GB/day commitment
   - Provides up to 25% discount on ingestion costs
   - Predictable monthly billing

3. **Sentinel capabilities** - Charged per GB analyzed in the Sentinel workspace
   - Currently ~$0.25 per GB beyond free allocations
   - Enterprise agreements may include additional discounts

4. **Long-term data retention** - Required for regulatory compliance
   - 7-year retention for SOX compliance
   - Tiered storage strategy to minimize costs

### Free Data Sources

Microsoft offers the following data sources at no charge for Sentinel ingestion:

1. **Security alerts** from Microsoft security products:
   - Microsoft Defender XDR
   - Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps
   - Microsoft Defender for Cloud
   - Microsoft Defender for Identity
   - Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

2. **Azure Activity logs**

3. **Office 365 Audit logs** - Available through the Microsoft 365 E5 benefit offer (up to 5MB per user/day)

It's important to note that while alerts from these products are free, raw event data is not. This distinction is critical for cost optimization.

## Defender XDR Integration Strategy

### Alert-level vs. Raw Telemetry Ingestion

A critical decision in the Sentinel-XDR integration is whether to ingest only alerts/incidents or also raw telemetry data.

#### Optimal Approach: Alert-Only Integration

**Recommendation:** Ingest only high-level alerts/incidents from Defender XDR into Sentinel.

**Benefits:**
- **Zero additional cost** - Microsoft security alerts are free to ingest
- **Reduced data volume** - Alerts are significantly smaller than raw event streams
- **Maintained correlation capability** - Sentinel can still correlate XDR alerts with other data sources
- **Complete investigation context** - Each incident contains entity information and links to the Defender portal for detailed investigation

**Implementation:**
1. Configure the Microsoft Defender XDR connector with "Incidents" mode enabled
2. Do not enable raw event streaming options
3. Use the incident link to pivot to Defender XDR for detailed investigation

#### When Raw Data Ingestion Might Make Sense

While generally not recommended, there are specific scenarios where ingesting some raw XDR data could be justified:

1. **Compliance requirements** for long-term retention exceeding Defender's 30-day limit
2. **Custom detection** needs that cannot be addressed in Defender XDR's Custom Detection Rules
3. **Specialized correlation** requirements across disparate data sources

In these cases, consider:
- Using the Basic/Auxiliary tier workspace for this data
- Implementing aggressive filtering to limit volume
- Scoping to only the specific event types needed

## Data Tiering Approach

A multi-tier workspace architecture provides optimal cost savings:

### 1. Central Sentinel Workspace (Analytics Tier)

- **Content:** Critical alerts and minimally required security events
- **Source:** Defender incidents, critical filtered logs, alerts
- **Cost tier:** Analytics tier (~$2.76/GB)
- **Usage:** Active hunting, incident investigation, real-time detection
- **Retention:** Default 90 days (sufficient for active security operations)

### 2. Verbose Logs Workspace (Auxiliary/Basic Tier)

- **Content:** Full event logs, verbose telemetry, compliance data
- **Source:** Complete Windows events, all syslog, full network logs
- **Cost tier:** Basic/Auxiliary tier (~$0.74/GB - 73% savings)
- **Usage:** Compliance queries, forensic investigation, occasional context lookup
- **Retention:** Extended (365+ days based on compliance requirements)

### 3. Staging Workspace (Analytics/Basic Tier)

- **Content:** Pre-processed data for advanced analytics
- **Source:** Data requiring correlation before alerting (e.g., VPN logs, custom app logs)
- **Cost tier:** Can use either tier depending on query frequency
- **Usage:** Pre-alert analysis, aggregation, data preparation
- **Retention:** Short (30 days or less, just enough for correlation)

## Ingestion Volume Management

### DCR Transformation for Filtering

Data Collection Rules (DCRs) with ingestion-time transformations are your primary tool for cost management:

1. **Filtering before ingestion:**
   ```kql
   source | where EventID in (4624, 4625, 4672, 4720, 4726, 4740, 1102)
   ```

2. **Field-level filtering:**
   ```kql
   source | project TimeGenerated, Computer, EventID, Account, Activity 
   ```

3. **Conditional routing:**
   ```kql
   source | where SeverityLevel <= 3 or EventID in (4624, 4625, 4672)
   ```

### Typical Transformation Patterns

1. **Critical Security Events:**
   - Send only specific EventIDs to Sentinel (4624, 4625, 4672, etc.)
   - Send all events to verbose workspace

2. **Network Logs:**
   - Send only deny/alert traffic to Sentinel
   - Send all traffic to verbose workspace

3. **Application Logs:**
   - Send only errors/warnings to Sentinel
   - Send all logs to verbose workspace

### Workspace-level DCR for Platform Logs

For Azure resource logs that don't support DCRs natively, use workspace-level transformation DCRs:

```kql
source | where Category == "AzureFirewallApplicationRule" 
| where properties_msg has_any ("Deny", "ThreatIntel", "IDS", "Alert")
```

- **Total monthly cost: $656.00**

**Cost savings vs. Scenario 2: $1,010.00 per month (61% savings)**

## Monitoring and Optimization Tools

### Usage and Estimated Costs Dashboard

Monitor the "Usage and estimated costs" blade in each workspace to track:
- Data ingestion by table
- Data trend analysis
- Cost projections

### Data Volume Queries

1. **Ingestion by table:**
   ```kql
   Usage
   | where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
   | summarize TotalGB=sum(Quantity)/1000 by DataType
   | sort by TotalGB desc
   ```

2. **Daily trend analysis:**
   ```kql
   Usage
   | where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
   | summarize DailyGB=sum(Quantity)/1000 by bin(TimeGenerated, 1d)
   | render timechart
   ```

3. **Cost projection:**
   ```kql
   Usage
   | where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
   | summarize DailyGB=sum(Quantity)/1000 by bin(TimeGenerated, 1d)
   | summarize AvgDailyGB=avg(DailyGB)
   | extend ProjectedMonthlyGB=AvgDailyGB*30
   | extend ProjectedMonthlyCost=ProjectedMonthlyGB*2.76
   ```

### Regular Optimization Process

Implement a monthly optimization cycle:

1. **Review ingestion volumes** using the queries above
2. **Identify high-volume tables** that could be moved to the Basic tier
3. **Refine DCR transformations** to filter aggressively
4. **Validate alert effectiveness** to ensure filtering doesn't impact security
5. **Adjust workspace configurations** based on findings

## Regulatory Compliance Considerations

Implementing Azure Sentinel while adhering to SOX, GDPR, and CCPA requirements introduces specific challenges and cost considerations:

### SOX Compliance Requirements

* **Data Retention**: 7-year (2557 days) retention period for all security-relevant logs
* **Data Integrity**: Immutable storage and protection against unauthorized modification
* **Access Controls**: Strict RBAC implementation with segregation of duties
* **Audit Trails**: Complete logs of security-relevant activities

### GDPR and CCPA Compliance Requirements

* **Data Minimization**: Store only necessary personal data
* **Right to Erasure**: Ability to identify and remove specific personal data
* **Data Protection**: Encryption at rest and in transit
